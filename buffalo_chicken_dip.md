## Alex's Buffalo Chicken Dip

## Ingredients
- 2 blocks of neufchatel cheese
- Full fat sour cream (1-3 cups)
- Shredded cheddar
- 2 or 3 large cans of chicken
- Herbs
- Wing Sauce, at least 1 bottle (use your favorite)

## Stuff
- Small pot
- Dish to bake the thing in, like a large pyrex dish
- Preheat the oven (somewhere between 350F and 425F)

## Process
- Start heating up the neufchatel cheese and enough sour cream to make it a smooth enough consistency and after it melts (and makes it enough to be a layer in the dish). Also add the herbs and some ranch mix. I like dill. A little buttermilk isn't a bad thing to add if you have it. 
- Drain the cans of chicken and dump the chicken into the baking dish. Add the wing sauce and break up lumps of chicken. It should have a ratio of sauce-to-chicken that makes the chicken cover the bottom, but the mix isn't terribly soupy.
- Spread the now-melted dairy & herb mix over the top of the chicken mix.
- Top it all with cheddar
- Put it in the oven for about 40 minutes, until the top is browned an bubbly
- If your dish can take it, put it under the broiler for about 3 minutes to finish browning up the cheese
- It will be like lava for longer than you expect, but be sure to put holes in the cheese layer while it's cooling, or the first person to eat it will take the whole cheese layer with them.
- Eat with (tortilla) chips, celery, carrots, bread, whatever.
